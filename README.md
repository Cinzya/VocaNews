# Features

The app automatically collects data from multiple pre-definied blogs via their RSS feeds. An option to provide the user to add their own sources is not intended yet since the app is focused around VOCALOID as a topic and should include such sources.

- **Home:**
Shows a list of all blogs. It gives information about the name and a short discription of given blogs. Clicking on those brings you to the feed screen.

- **Feed:**
Shows a list of all recent blog posts of given blog including a thumbnail image, title of said post, and publishing date. Clicking on those brings you to the entry screen.

- **Entry:**
Shows the full content of given blog posts including links and images. Clicking on links redirects you to your browser.

## Work in progress
### Delete & Save 
An option to delete and save blog posts from your feed with a swipe gesture.

### Categories
